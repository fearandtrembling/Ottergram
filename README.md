# Ottergram

Project from the book ["Front-End Web Development" by Chris Aquino and Todd Gandee](https://www.amazon.com/Front-End-Web-Development-Ranch-Guides/dp/0134433947/)

>In your first project, you will create a web-based photo gallery. Building Ottergram
will teach you the fundamentals of programming for the browser using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. You will build the user interface manually, learning how the browser
loads and renders content.
